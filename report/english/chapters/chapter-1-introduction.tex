\section{Background}
The rise of information technology has significantly impacted business operations, with software applications becoming integral to sales operations. However, choosing the right software and platform can be challenging, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Traditionally, many businesses have used monolithic architecture, a unified and self-contained model. While this model is convenient in the early stages of a project, it can become complex and hard to manage as the application grows.

To address these challenges, businesses are now turning to the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js). This stack allows for a scalable and maintainable system, providing a rich, user-friendly interface.

For instance, a sport equipment shop website can be developed using the MEVN stack. By breaking down the application into smaller parts, it's easier to scale services based on demand and deploy updates more frequently without disrupting the entire system.

Sport equipment shop websites can use the MEVN stack to manage products, inventory, orders, and payments, making it easier to add new features, scale as needed, and ensure system reliability.
\section{Problem statement}
% The traditional monolithic architecture, while convenient early on, becomes less efficient as the application grows in size. To address these challenges, the e-shop needs to adopt microservices architecture.
\textbf{Challenge}: E-commerce enterprises, particularly SMEs, face the challenge of selecting scalable software solutions that can accommodate their growth trajectory. While monolithic architectures initially offer simplicity in code management and deployment, they become increasingly complex and unwieldy as applications expand.

\textbf{Solution}: To address these challenges, there is a need for a new approach: the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js). This stack allows for a scalable and maintainable system, providing a rich, user-friendly interface.

\textbf{Objective}: The objective of this project is to implement a new sport equipment shop website using the MEVN stack from the ground up. The website will have minimal features due to the project's short deadline.

\textbf{Aim:} By adopting the MEVN stack from the start, the sport equipment shop website aims to develop and deploy new features more easily, scale as needed, and improve the overall reliability of the system.

\section{Research Objectives}
The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a microservices-based e-commerce application for a souvenir e-shop, along with a front-end application using Flutter. The specific objectives are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{Literature Review:} Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on the MEVN stack, its benefits, challenges, and best practices. This will provide a theoretical foundation for the project.
    \item[-] \textbf{Design:} Design a MEVN-based e-commerce application model. The design should consider factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of adding new features. In parallel, design a front-end application using Vue.js.
    \item[-] \textbf{Development:} Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) of an e-commerce application for a sport equipment shop website using the proposed model. The MVP will include key features such as product management, inventory management, order processing, and payment processing.
    \item[-] \textbf{Documentation:} Document the entire process, including the design decisions made, challenges encountered, solutions implemented, and lessons learned. This will serve as a valuable resource for future projects of similar nature.

\section{Research Scope}
The focus of this research is on the design and implementation of a MEVN-based e-commerce application for a sport equipment shop website.
The specific areas covered in this research include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{MEVN Stack:} The research will delve into the principles and practices of the MEVN stack. It will explore how to design and implement an e-commerce application using this stack.
    \item[-] \textbf{Front-end Development with Vue.js: } he research will also cover the design and implementation of a front-end application using Vue.js.
    \item[-] \textbf{Key Features: } The research will focus on implementing key features for an e-commerce application, such as product management, inventory management, order processing, and payment processing.
    \item[-] \textbf{Evaluation:} The research will include an evaluation of the implemented system in terms of functionality, performance, scalability, and reliability.
\end{itemize}

Please note that while the research aims to cover these areas, it is limited by the project's short time. Therefore, the e-shop application developed as part of this project will be a minimum viable product (MVP) with basic features.
\section{Solution approach}
The approach to solving the problem at hand involves several steps, each designed to ensure the successful implementation of a microservices-based e-commerce application for a souvenir e-shop, along with a front-end application using Flutter. The steps are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] \textbf{Literature Review:} The first step involves conducting a comprehensive review of existing literature on the MEVN stack. This will provide a theoretical foundation for the project and inform the design and implementation stages.
    \item[-] \textbf{Design:} The next step is to design the MEVN-based e-commerce application model. The design will take into account factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of adding new features.
    \item[-] \textbf{Development:} Once the design is complete, the development of the minimum viable product (MVP) begins. This involves coding the back-end services and front-end application, and setting up the necessary databases and interfaces.
    \item[-] \textbf{Testing: :} After the MVP is developed, it will be thoroughly tested to ensure it functions as expected. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
    \item[-] \textbf{Evaluation:} The MVP will then be evaluated in terms of its functionality, performance, scalability, and reliability. Feedback from this evaluation will be used to identify areas for improvement.
