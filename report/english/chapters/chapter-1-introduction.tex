\section{Background}
% What is the motivation for your research?
The rapid development of information technology has revolutionized various fields, including business operations. To enhance management quality and increase revenue, businesses are increasingly integrating software applications into their sales operations. However, selecting a suitable software application and platform can be challenging, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Monolithic architecture is a traditional model of software design that is built as a unified unit, self-contained, and independent from other applications. It can be convenient early on in a project's life for ease of code management, cognitive overhead, and deployment. However, as the size of the application increases, its start-up and deployment time also increases.
% Monolithic architecture is a traditional way of designing software. It's built as one unit that is separate from other applications. It can be useful at the start of a project because it's easy to manage the code and deploy the application. But, as the application gets bigger, it takes longer to start up and deploy.

Other way to address the challenges of selecting a software application and platform is to adopt microservices architecture. Microservices architecture is a software design approach that breaks down an application into a collection of small, independent services. Each microservice has its own business logic and database, and it can be deployed and scaled independently.
% Microservices architecture is another way to choose software and platform. It breaks an application into small, independent services. Each service has its own business logic and database. It can be deployed and scaled on its own.

% Souvenir e-shops can adopt microservices architecture by breaking down their e-shop application into smaller, more manageable services. For example, they could create separate microservices for product management, inventory management, order processing, and payment processing. This would make it easier to develop and deploy new features, scale their e-shop as needed, and improve the overall reliability of their system.

\section{Problem statement}
The traditional monolithic architecture, while convenient early on, becomes less efficient as the application grows in size. To address these challenges, the e-shop needs to adopt microservices architecture.

The objective is to break down the e-shop application into smaller, independent services such as product management, inventory management, order processing, and payment processing.

By adopting microservices architecture, the souvenir e-shop aims to achieve the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Develop and deploy new features more easily.
    \item[-] Scale the e-shop as needed.
    \item[-] Improve overall reliability of the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Objectives}
The objectives of this study are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Research and build a microservices-based e-commerce application model using ASP.NET and Clean Architecture.
    \item[-] Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) of an e-commerce application for a souvenir shop using the proposed model.
    \item[-] Evaluate the MVP and identify areas for improvement.
\end{itemize}
% What are the main contributions of your thesis?
\section{Research Scope}
This study is limited to the development of an MVP of an e-commerce application for a souvenir shop using Microservices and Clean Architecture. Additional features and functionality may be added in the future.
\section{Solution approach}
The following steps will be taken to implement the proposed solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct a literature review to learn about existing approaches to e-commerce application development.
    \item Design a microservices-based e-commerce application model using ASP.NET and Clean Architecture.
    \item Develop an MVP of an e-commerce application for a souvenir shop using the proposed model.
    \item Evaluate the MVP and identify areas for improvement.
\end{enumerate}
