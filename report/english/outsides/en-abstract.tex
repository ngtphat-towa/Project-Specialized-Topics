    This project is dedicated to the development of an online sport equipment shop website. The website will serve as an online marketplace for various sports equipment, providing a seamless and familiar shopping experience for users.

    The development process will utilize the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) and Bootstrap, following the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach to build a small monolithic website. This approach ensures a scalable and maintainable system, while also providing a rich, user-friendly interface.

    The scope of the project is focused on creating a compact application that satisfies the fundamental requirements of an e-commerce website. This includes features such as product listing, shopping cart functionality, order processing, user authentication, wishlist management, and product reviews.

    The expected outcomes of this project include gaining a deeper understanding of full-stack web development using the MEVN stack, the MVP approach, and the business aspects of running an e-commerce website. The project serves as a practical application of these technologies and concepts, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
