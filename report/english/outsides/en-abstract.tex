    This project is aimed at creating an online marketplace for sports equipment, offering users a seamless and intuitive shopping experience. The website will be developed using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js), supplemented with Bootstrap for responsive design, and TypeScript for static typing, enhancing code quality and understandability.

    The development process will adhere to the principles of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, resulting in a compact, single-tiered website. This approach ensures the system is scalable, maintainable, and provides a rich, user-friendly interface.
    
    The projectâ€™s scope is concentrated on fulfilling the essential features of an e-commerce website, including product listing, shopping cart functionality, order processing, user authentication, wishlist management, and product reviews.
    
    The anticipated outcomes of this project include a deeper comprehension of full-stack web development using the MEVN stack, understanding the MVP approach, and gaining insights into the operational aspects of an e-commerce website. This project serves as a practical application of these technologies and concepts, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
