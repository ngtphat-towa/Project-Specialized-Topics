    This project aims to develop an online souvenir shop application using ASP.NET microservices and Flutter. The application will serve as an online store selling various physical products like t-shirts and coffee mugs, providing a familiar experience for those who have shopped online before.

    The development process will utilize the microservices architecture with ASP.NET for the backend API, and Flutter for the frontend mobile application. This approach allows for a scalable and maintainable system, while also providing a rich, user-friendly interface.
    
    The scope of the project is focused on creating a small application that satisfies the minimum requirements of an e-shop application. This includes features such as product listing, shopping cart functionality, and order processing.
    
    The expected outcomes of this project include gaining a deeper understanding of microservices architecture, application development using Flutter and ASP.NET, and the business aspects of running an e-shop. The project serves as a practical application of these technologies and concepts, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
